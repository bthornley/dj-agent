# GigLift Brand Ambassador Program
## Business Development Plan — February 2026

---

## Executive Summary

GigLift's Brand Ambassador Program turns our most engaged users — working DJs, bands, solo artists, and music instructors — into advocates who drive organic sign-ups in exchange for free product access, revenue share, and exclusive perks. Ambassadors promote GigLift within their local music scenes, online communities, and professional networks, creating a scalable, low-CAC growth engine.
